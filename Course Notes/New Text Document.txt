what is html?
- tags, opening and closing tags
- hypertext markup language
- defines the structure of a webpages words and images
- <!DOCTYPE html> = html5
- 

Body
 Header (menu buttons)
  Nav (holds menu elements "a" elements) a href="index.html">Home</a>
 Main <img src="voyager.jpg" alt="docking station"> does not have open and closing tags since no addl content
 Footer

good practice to leave things lower case (all elements, not content)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>There She Blows</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 </body>
</html>

Squoosh - shrinks images for you to specific sizes, like paint, but on the web for web loading

Images should never be more than 100 kB in size. Should be resized downward and quality reduced if they are bigger than that
