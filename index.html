        <p>My name is Kevin Shirley. I live in Utah, am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and
            have a wife and seven kids. I enjoy most activities, but tend towards nerdy stuff. For instance, I taught my
            kids to play different TTRPG's similar to Dungeons and Dragons, and never stop talking to them about
            homebrew system improvements that would modify gameplay and the feel of the game.</p>
